# Smart Healthcare Appointment System

## Overview
The Smart Healthcare Appointment System is a web application where patients can find and book appointments with doctors based on availability and health requirements. The system utilizes AI/ML to predict optimal time slots for booking and provides administrators with analytics to manage appointments effectively.

### Key Features:
- **AI/ML-Powered Time Slot Prediction**: Predict the best time slots for booking appointments based on historical data.
- **Doctor Availability & Scheduling**: View available doctors and schedule appointments accordingly.
- **Role-Based Authentication**: Admin, doctor, and patient roles with specific privileges.
- **RESTful API**: APIs for booking appointments, retrieving doctor details, and managing schedules.
- **Data Visualization Dashboards**: Visual analytics for administrators to view appointment trends, doctor workload, and cancellation rates.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Deployed on a cloud platform for global access.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Django, Django REST Framework (DRF)
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, Pandas (for model building and data analysis)
- **Frontend**: (Optional: Add details of frontend framework if applicable, e.g., React.js, Bootstrap)
- **Deployment**: AWS, Heroku (or any other cloud platform)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (or any relational database)

AI/ML:
Train a machine learning model to predict the best time slots for appointments based on historical data.
Implement a feature to predict high-demand days for doctors.

Django:
Develop the backend to manage doctors, patients, appointments, and feedback.
Include user authentication and role-based access (e.g., patient, doctor, admin).

DRF:
Create REST APIs for booking appointments, retrieving doctor details, and managing schedules.
Ensure API documentation is available using Swagger or Postman.

Data Visualization:
Design dashboards showing doctor workload, appointment trends, and cancellation rates.

Deployment:
Deploy the application to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku).

Deliverables:
A functioning web application for booking appointments.
Machine learning models integrated with the backend.
APIs with proper authentication and error handling.
Visual dashboards for administrators.
