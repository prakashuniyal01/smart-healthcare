DRF:
Create REST APIs for booking appointments, retrieving doctor details, and managing schedules.
Ensure API documentation is available using Swagger or Postman.

Data Visualization:
Design dashboards showing doctor workload, appointment trends, and cancellation rates.

Deployment:
Deploy the application to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku).

Deliverables:
A functioning web application for booking appointments.
Machine learning models integrated with the backend.
APIs with proper authentication and error handling.
Visual dashboards for administrators.
